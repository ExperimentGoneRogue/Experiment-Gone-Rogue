# Experiment Gone Rogue

The Doughnut

This repository contains a small Unreal Engin 4 project that allows you to play around with 
the code of the doughnut in our game Experiment Gone Rogue. You also get 2 pictures of a bunch of dougnhuts that we use in the game. :D
There is also a video that shows how the doughnuts should work in the game in you attach models and physics to them.
 
 Experiment Gone Rogue is a VR action game and the doughnut is a health item in it. 
 This repository does not contain other parts of the game. 
 
 The doughnut can spawn in 12 variations. It can be 3 different flavors and have 4 different toppings.
